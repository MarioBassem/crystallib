## dal = domain abstraction layer = models

- ! : model dsl action = models
  - $domain.$rootobjectname.define
    - id: is a smartid (use *** to let it be filled in automatically)
    - name: optional
    - descripton: optional
    - tags: is in params format (see filter mechanism)
  - $domain.$rootobjectname.delete (or del)
    - id
  - $domain.$rootobjectname.get (returns the data)
    - id
    - format: heroscript or json
  - $domain.$rootobjectname.list (returns id's and name's of found rootobjects)
    - namefilter: part of name in filter format see [filtering](filtering.md)
    - includefilter: see [tags](tags.md)
    - excludefilter: see [tags](tags.md)
    - format: heroscript or json
  - example rootobjectnames: project, user, contact, story, ...
  - domain is optional, if not mentioned then is core.  which is our default
  - id:'***' automatically fill in id
    - means will be filled in automatically
  - name & id can be used interchangeable to link 2 objects to each other
    - e.g. in an object story:'ed4' would belink to a smart if.
    - e.g. in an object story:'my_story' would be link to a object with name my_story
  - each rootobject has unique smart id (sid) and this is unique per circle.
  - when working with rootobjects this is always done per circle
