## Include Remote

Below we attempt at including a page without giving it a collection name, and this page isn't in our current collection smallbook2! But not to worry, knowledgetree should still be able to find the page from the other collection and include it without outputting an error

!!include regular_page

If you see the "Regular Page" page above, it worked!
