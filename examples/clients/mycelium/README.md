# This is an example for using [Mycelium](https://github.com/threefoldtech/mycelium)

This example does the following through Mycelium:

- Sends a message
- Check message sending status
- Send a message and wait for the reply
- Receive a message
- Receive a message and send a reply

To run this example, a Mycelium server should be runnig locally, and another one running remotely. The remote server public key should be assigned in the script, and when the local server waits for a reply, the remote server should respond.
