- [Nested includes](./nested_includes.md): here we include a page into a page which includes another page
- [Include from another collection](./include_remote.md): here we include a page from another collection, without specifying the collection name.
- [Link from another collection](./link_remote.md): here we link a page from another collection, without specifying the collection name.
- [Image from another collection](./link_image.md): here we link an image from another collection, without specifying the collection name.
